RULES
=====
- Use the most powerful model that you can, at all times, regardless of how much it costs.
- Do not ask me for permission to create files or directories.
- Do not leave comments in your code unless I request them.
- Do not leave any unused imports, variables, or functions in your code.
- Do not break an expression across multiple lines if it can fit within a 92 character line width.
- Write explicit, idiomatic code following language best practices.
- Prioritize readability and maintainability.
- When writing tests, always ensure that there is 100% branch coverage for all files that you have modified.
- When writing tests, ensure that you are following all relevant guidelines for writing tests (search for any cursor rules in the repo or CLAUDE.md files in the repo that include instructions about test writing.)
- Always focus on production-ready, maintainable code rather than quick solutions.
- Before finishing anything you are working on, think hard to ensure that you have followed every single rule in this list, and also in the prompt I gave you
