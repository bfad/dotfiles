Your goal is to run the tests for the current ruby file. 

- If the current file is not a ruby file, then please inform my that I have made a mistake.
- If the current file is a test file (the file name ends with "_test.rb") then run the tests in this file.
- If the current file is not a test file, try to find the corresponding test file and run those tests. Corresponding test files live in the nearest "test" folder and have a similar relative path underneath the test folder and should have the same file name with "_test" appended before the ".rb" extension.
